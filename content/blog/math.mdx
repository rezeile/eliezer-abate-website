#### Introduction

There are a lot of interesting basic math questions that make for good
algorithm questions. Most of these questions don't require any
specialized knowledge except for elementary school level math, but they
will require careful thinking to answer correctly.

#### An Example

Count the number of primes less than a non-negative number n. The naive
way to solve this problem would be to check each number and test whether
it is divisible by any other number other than 1. But there is a better
algorithm called the sieve of Eratosthenes named after Eratosthenes of
Alexandria. The idea is to initially declare an array of booleans called
primes and set every value between 0 - n to true as 'probably prime'.
Then we set 1 and 0 to false. Then we consider all factors of the number
less than its square root. Then beginning with 2 (which is set to true
as a prime) we cross out all multiples of two as non-prime. We do this
with 3 and all numbers until we hit out end condition,
