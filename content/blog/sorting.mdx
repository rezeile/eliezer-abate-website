#### Introduction

In typical interviews you will rarely encounter problems that will
directly ask you to sort an array of integers. You might, however,
encounter a question that asks you to sort a linked list. Thus it’s
important to become familiar with the techniques used in common sorting
algorithms.  
  
Usually sorting creeps its head in when it is *an intermediate* step in
a multi-step process to solve a problem. At other times the problem
statement will make clear that you are dealing with a sorted array and
you should use that information to help you arrive at an optimal
solution. If the input array you are dealing with is already sorted then
that’s a big hint you should probably consider binary search before
considering a less optimal linear time solution.   
  

#### O(N) algorithms 

*Counting Sort*

Counting sort works by counting the frequency of each unique item and
then outputting the items in order. If an item occurs k times , we'll
place it k consecutive times. We will assume that we know the ordering
of the unique items. For example if we have items 0 - 6, we know 0

*Insertion Sort.*

*Selection Sort**

Selection sort also uses the same principle as insertion sort and keeps
a partially sorted array to the left of the item currently being
processed. While in insertion sort we continually modify the partially
sorted array by inserting a new element somewhere in between its
smallest and largest value, in selection sort the partially sorted items
are in their final position.

We front load the work and each time try to find the smallest value to
the right and adding it as the next item in the partially sorted array
to our left. This contrasts with insertion sort where we never examine
the items to the right of the value we are processing.

*Bubble Sort**

Bubble sort will keep a partially sorted array on the far right hand
side. Assuming we want to sort in ascending order we will continually
bubbling the largest items to the right by finding the largest item seen
so far and move it to the right, then the second largest item and so
forth. Once we have processed all elements our final array will be
sorted. For bubble sort the partial sort is on the right hand side and
thus its different from selection sort and insertion sort in this
manner. It is similar to the selection sort though in that the partially
sorted items in the right are in their final position.

#### Other Notes

A sorting algorithm is **stable** if two elements in the input array
with identical keys appear in the same order when the sorted output is
processed. Heapsort and Quicksort algorithms are unstable, whereas merge
sort and insertion sort are. The key takeaway is stability only matters
when the input array contains duplicate values.
