# Understanding Bit Manipulation in Computer Science

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves the manipulation of individual bits in a computer's memory. It's a powerful technique that can lead to highly optimized code when used correctly.

## Why is Bit Manipulation Important?

Bit manipulation operations are generally very fast and can significantly improve performance in certain scenarios. Some common applications include:

- Optimizing storage by packing multiple values into a single integer
- Fast arithmetic operations
- Implementing flags and toggling states
- Low-level device control

## Basic Bit Operations

Here are the fundamental bit operations used in programming:

### AND Operation (&)

The AND operation returns 1 only if both bits are 1:
