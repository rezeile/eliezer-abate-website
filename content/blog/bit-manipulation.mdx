#### Introduction

Technical interviews at large tech companies such as Facebook, Google,
Netflix etc … will test your understanding of fundamental Computer
Science techniques.   

Bit manipulation questions come up frequently and are intended to test
one’s fluency with working with unary bit operators such as: ^ (xor), \|
(or), & (and), \\> (right shift), ~ (not).  
  
For example to check if the *3rd* bit of the integer 7 is set (7 is
represented as 0111 in binary), all we have to do is the
following: (0111) & (1 \ 3 neighbors dies
- A dead cell with 3 live neighbors becomes alive  

This question asks us to compute the next state of the matrix *without*
utilizing another matrix.

*Applying above rules to 4 x 3 matrix*

  
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that each cell
utilizes exactly a single bit to store information even though each cell
is made up of 32-bit integers. Thus we can solve this problem by storing
the next state in the second least significant bit position and when we
are done processing every cell we can shift the value in the second bit
back to the least significant bit and return the answer in the original
matrix we were given. The solution follows below.

Observe that in line 19 *n* the number of neighbors and we perform a
bitwise OR (\|) with the value. If we have a live cell denoted by the
integer 1, 01 then the bitwise or of n=2, 10 or n=3 11 and 1 will always
be three and we set the second bit by adding 2. For a dead cell, 00, we
set the second bit only if the count is n=3, 11 which will result in a
value of three when we do 00 \| 11.  
  
Finally we move the second bit values to the first bit and place the
matrix in its final position.

#### Some Bit Tricks

Set ith bit: num \|= num & (1 \<\< i)

Clear ith bit: num &= ~(1 \<\< i)

Clear least significant set bit: num &= num-1
