#### Introduction

Suppose a group of 100 people are in a line and they are standing from
shortest to tallest where the shortest person is on the left side and
the tallest person is on the right side. You want to join the line but
to do so you must honor the rules of the line and find a position where
the person to your left is shorter than you and the person to your right
is taller than you and insert yourself the middle. Of course if you are
the shortest you can simply go to the far left and if you are the
tallest to the right without having to do much work. But like most
people, if you are somewhere in between, you need to do some
searching.  

One approach to find where you belong is to begin from the shortest
person and one by one move to the right until the right conditions are
satisfied. Although this approach works it is not the most efficient. A
better approach would be to find the person at the middle of the line
and compare your height to that person. If you are taller than that
person you know that you can eliminate searching through all people to
the left. Similarly if you are shorter than the middle person you can
eliminate searching through the taller half of the line on the right
side.  
  
The binary search algorithm works exactly this way. Binary search is
used to find an element in a sorted array and to do so the algorithm
first finds the middle element and based on the result it eliminates one
half of the array which is irrelevant to it. It continues this process
until the element is found or it determines the element does not
exist.   

#### An Example

*Problem Description*

An integer array *nums* is sorted in ascending order and contains
**distinct** values. We rotate the array **k** positions to the right.
Your task is to determine if a value **target** belongs to the array and
return the index at which it's located. If target is not in the array,
we should return -1. For example if we had an initial array
\[1,2,3,4,5\] if we rotate it by k=2, it becomes \[4,5,1,2,3\] and
target = 1. In this case target is located at index 3.  
  
The key insight to to solving this problem is to find the pivot element
first in O(logN) time doing a binary search. The pivot element is the
single element which is greater than the element to its right. If the
array is not rotated at all the pivot element is the last element. Then
after finding the pivot element we need to determine whether the target
value falls to the left or to the right of the array and perform binary
search to find it.  
  
The code follows below:

Binary Search (first in findPivot then in
search)

Observe in the above example we had *L

Loop condition to check first value larger than the
target.
