#####  

Ethiopia is a diverse country of 110 million people made up of 80+
ethnic groups and languages. It's also the lone African country to
successfully repel European colonization in the late 19th century.

In the 20th century the country went through some of the most dramatic
political upheavals anywhere in the world. One of these was in 1991,
when a rebel group from Tigray, the TPLF, fighting alongside Eritrean
freedom fighters overthrew the government.

Eritrea became an independent country and the TPLF took over power in
Ethiopia.

The new TPLF-led government dramatically reshaped Ethiopia by rejecting
a single national Ethiopian identity and centering Ethiopian political
life along ethnic and tribal lines. This was formalized in a new
constitution introduced in 1995 where 9 ethnic states were created. This
was a radically new concept in Ethiopia.

Under the new framework, each territorial region belonged to a single
ethnic group. One of these ethnic regions is Tigray where the conflict
is centered today and the home-base of the TPLF.

As an illustration, what happened in 1995 would be like a new US
President or Congress deciding with a stroke of a pen that: Georgia
would belong \*only\* to black people; California only to Asians;
Arizona only to whites, Texas for only Mexicans etc ...

*Example of ethnic-federalism*

Since the TPLF represented only 6% of the country, in order to gain
nationwide legitimacy, it invited (some say created) three more
compliant ethnic political parties and formed an umbrella organization
called the EPRDF through which it dominated Ethiopia for 3 decades.

The TPLF had sweeping control of the Ethiopian state, controlling more
than 70% of top positions in the military and security forces and
dominating the economy through a handful of state-owned companies which
funneled billions of dollars into the TPLF's own coffers.  

In 2018 following nearly three years of nationwide protests against the
EPRDF and TPLF's minority rule in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian people
demanded reforms & democratization. After internal deliberations within
the EPRDF, a man named Abiy Ahmed was selected to lead the reforms.  

Immediately the new leader introduced radical reforms by welcoming back
exiled politicians; cracking down on corruption; filling half of his
cabinet with women and making peace with Eritrea, a bitter enemy of the
former TPLF-led government.

Abiy won the Noble prize for the peace deal with Eritrea. The Prime
Minister's new relationship with Eritrea deeply angered the TPLF and
made them suspicious of his motives.

Under the peace agreement Ethiopia would cede a small part of the
disputed territory in Tigray which the TPLF's leaders laid claim to and
which the Ethiopian military had been protecting for close to two
decades following a bitter border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

The straw that broke the camel's back between the TPLF and the new Prime
Minister occurred in late 2019 when the new PM disavowed the ethnic
makeup of the EPRDF and created a single non-ethnic political party to
replace it.

The TPLF refused to join the new party and finalized its retreat back to
its home-base of Tigray to govern the region with as little interference
as possible from the new PM based in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.

As the PM cracked down on the previous regime's corruption, the TPLF
promptly began accusing him of ethnic-profiling and shielded their
members from arrest in their home region of Tigray.  (They had a sizable
armed regional militia).

Their accusation was certainly ridiculous given that they themselves
were the ones which constructed Ethiopia along ethnic lines and made
themselves vulnerable by ensuring that their party representing 6% of
the country controlled every lever of state power.

In mid-2020 Ethiopia postponed its upcoming elections due to the COVID
19 pandemic. Ethiopia's election postponement was one of 76 elections
globally that was postponed due to COVID and certainly wasn't an eyebrow
raising move.

*Elections postponed during COVID*

The TPLF however charged that the PM didn't have the constitutional
authority to postpone elections and that they would go ahead and pursue
their regional elections as scheduled in September 2020 in Tigray.

The TPLF was itching for a confrontation with the Prime Minister and
declared that after October 5 2020 (when the PM's term 'expired') they
would not accept the federal government's legitimacy and all rules &
regulations coming from the PM would not be accepted in Tigray.

The PM on the other hand declared that the elections conducted in Tigray
in which the TPLF won more than "99%" of seats were invalid and stopped
federal funding for the region.  In the mean time, the TPLF refused all
bilateral peaceful dialogue with the Prime Minister insisting on banal
demands such as freeing political prisoners & having other parties
participate in a dialogue in order to presumably share power until the
new elections.  

When the PM appointed a new commander to lead the country's Northern
Command military branch stationed in Tigray, the TPLF poisoned the man
and sent him packing back declaring that the PM is illegitimate and does
not have authority to appoint military leaders.

Then on Nov 3, election eve in the United States, in what it called a
"pre-emptive" attack the TPLF ambushed and massacred hundreds of
Ethiopia's non-Tigrayan national military soldiers in their sleep.

The following day, the Prime Minister made an address to the country
saying that he has begun a law and order operation and military
offensive to respond to this unprecedented and treasonous attack and
bring the TPLF's leaders to justice.  

After about three weeks Ethiopian and allied regional forces had
captured all the major towns in Tigray and the TPLF's leaders went into
hiding. A few weeks later some of the major architects of the party were
captured and/or killed when they refused to surrender.

On social media, since the first day of the conflict, TPLF's supporters
began constructing a narrative that a war had been declared "on the
people Tigray" instead of the TPLF. That's like saying a war has been
declared on California because people are trying to recall governor
Gavin Newsom.  

TPLF supporters completely disregarded the fact that it was the TPLF
that had goaded the PM into a military offensive and that the operation
was intended to remove the party from power (not the people) and bring
them to justice for their massacre of Ethiopian soldiers.

Soon thereafter, "the war on Tigray" narrative morphed into what
activists began calling \#TigrayGenocide again to give the false
impression that there is some bloodthirsty African dictator that is out
to kill the Tigrayan people that they knew the western media would eat
up.

The Ethiopian government on the other hand had been hesitant to allow
western media or humanitarian agencies because it presumably feared
these organizations would be exploited by the TPLF (this was not
unfounded as the TPLF used aid orgs to smuggle weapons in the 80s).

As Joe Biden's administration came to power on Jan 20, it set an
aggressive tone against the Prime Minister's government which was
fulfilling its obligations in trying to restore law and order after an
insurrection had occurred just like the minor one that occurred in the
US. The US government along with international aid agencies began to
demand "unfettered" and "unrestricted access" to Tigray along with media
access. Journalists began to clamor daily on news articles and on
Twitter and started singularly assigning blame to the Ethiopian
government.

Organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
[began to
publish](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/ethiopia-eritrean-troops-massacre-of-hundreds-of-axum-civilians-may-amount-to-crime-against-humanity/)
what they claimed are unassailable evidence of massacres in a city
called Axum using nothing but phone calls to a few dozen people [with no
evidence of dead bodies or bullet
holes](https://jeffpearce.medium.com/ethiopia-lies-damn-lies-axum-and-the-west-242f471c45ae).

Slowly but surely the "genocide" narrative started by TPLF supporters as
a cynical ploy to draw attention \*away\* from the TPLF's atrocious
crimes and intransigence which led to the conflict  began to gain
support in western media. The tide of western public opinion decisively
turned against the Ethiopian government.

Nonetheless, there is NO genocide in Tigray. Genocide is the deliberate
killing of a large number of people from a particular ethnic group with
the aim of destroying that group.

There is  no force that is trying to destroy Tigrayans, they are
peace-loving Ethiopians, but there certainly are forces that will not
sleep until the remaining members of the TPLF are brought to justice.

That is not to say that there is no suffering in Tigray. The
humanitarian situation is real. People need food.  Medical facilities
and other critical infrastructure are badly damaged. The Ethiopian
government has reported massive destruction of infrastructure by the
TPLF as it was fleeing the major towns. And the government has opened up
full access to humanitarian aid and it reports that it is proving 70% of
the aid itself.

There is a PR campaign going on by western governments to see which one
of them can look most concerned about the situation in Tigray. Every day
or so a western politician releases a statement saying "I have deep
concerns about what's going on in Tigray" but the Ethiopian government
has reported they are coming empty handed and their concerns don't match
their action on the ground.

Supporters of the TPLF have one major goal: that is to revive the TPLF
from its sorry condition and bring it back to power somehow someway by
hook or by crook. They are using the real humanitarian challenges &
abusing the word genocide to paint a sensationalized picture that evokes
memories of gas chambers and machetes in the casual mind.  

The US government has also used terms like "ethnic cleansing" to
describe what appears to be displacement of people. These charged and
sensationalized headlines have made the propagators of the false
genocide narrative feel vindicated.

As with all conflicts, the conflict in Tigray is ugly and has incurred
collateral damage and casualties. The party responsible for the
suffering of Tigrayans is the TPLF which started an unprovoked conflict
because it was suffering from withdrawal symptoms from losing power.  

There is a legitimate humanitarian crisis in Tigray and the Ethiopian
government along with some international partners like the World Food
Program are addressing it. There are also some civilian casualties of
the conflict. But there is NO GENOCIDE in Tigray & it's deeply insulting
to real victims of genocide throughout history to use this term to
advance a political objective.

The Tigrayan people are suffering because their region was run by
deranged leaders of the TPLF who willingly decided to burn the house
down and chose self-destruction over peaceful co-existence with the rest
of the Ethiopian polity.
