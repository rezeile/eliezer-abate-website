On October 31st, 1978 TPLF militants abducted an American helicopter
pilot and triggered an international hostage crisis. What follows is the
untold story of how the TPLF introduced itself to the United States
\[1\] .


Northern Ethiopia faced a [severe locust
invasion](https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/06/archives/famineravaged-ethiopia-invaded-by-locust-swarm.html)
in 1978. According to a June 1978 Washington Post article, "43 swarms
\[of locusts\] have been spotted in Ethiopia" and locusts were devouring
"8,000 to 34,000 tons \[of vegetation\] each day". The UN's Desert
Locust Control Organization of Eastern Africa was at the forefront
addressing the crisis and had a fleet of 9 aircraft shared between seven
countries. One of these aircraft had been stranded near the Kola Tembien
region for three months and required several repairs.

At the time, George William Krois, was a 36 year old American helicopter
pilot and Canadian resident flying frequent locust control missions in
Tigray. George worked for Viking Helicopter Ltd., a Canadian contractor
performing services for the UN. On October 30th, Krois had flown two
missions ferrying mechanics to repair a UN spray aircraft that had been
grounded in Abiy Adi.

*George William Krois with his Viking Helicopter.*

According to an
[account](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04721_d.html)
given by Canadian Pilot Bill Waugh, a co-worker of Krois' at Viking
Helicopter, wages for locals guarding the aircraft had been delayed for
several days. Soon, locals guarding the grounded aircraft had began to
grumble. Word soon started to spread of a third flight that would
deliver their payments. TPLF bandits in the countryside heard these
rumors and quickly moved to the area.

On the arrival of the third mission, TPLF gunmen charged the helicopter,
held Krois under gunpoint and ordered him to reroute and fly to a
TPLF-held location. The gunmen stole all the cash and also kidnapped
four Ethiopian mechanics who arrived with Krois and instructed them to
walk 70 kms on foot in the same direction. Krois and the TPLF bandits
landed at a remote site and curious local peasants flocked toward the
helicopter. TPLF told the peasants that the helicopter "[was a gift from
the Arabs and that there would be
more](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04877_d.html)" to come
and loaded it on a truck and drove away.

#### Tigrayan Elders Enraged at TPLF

In Abiy Adi, Tigrayans were enraged by the abduction, fearing the UN
would suspend the highly effective Locust Control Program in their
community. The head of the UN's Locust Control Program in Addis, a man
by the name of Mulugetta Bizuneh heard the news of the abduction and
immediately dispatched locals from Abiy Adi to search for the TPLF
bandits in different directions, on foot, to try to contact the
guerillas and secure the release of his staff.


After a few days of searching, on the 5th of November, large crowds of
residents and church leaders finally found the TPLF bandits in the
countryside. The crowd, who had travelled a long distance, demanded the
TPLF release George Krois and the four Ethiopians.


The TPLF rebuffed their demands and told the crowd that the captives
were "[agents of the Ethiopian
government](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04820_d.html)".
The crowds forcefully protested and argued that the captives were civil
servants helping their community battle locust swarms.


When the uproar from the crowd wouldn't relent, the TPLF agreed to hold
a detailed deliberation under the [condition that church leaders
leave](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04820_d.html). The
crowds strongly objected. Then TPLF leaders began a one hour lecture
explaining their discomfort with crosses and church leaders.

*Ethiopian Orthodox Church Leader with a Cross.*


At last, the sides agreed to have a meeting in which church leaders were
cast to one side and villagers to another. The TPLF, then proceeded to
deliver another two hour lecture, this time about the goal of its
movement as described in its manifesto. The crowd, then became very
agitated.


The meeting adjourned without a discussion on the captives. The evening
arrived and the frustrated crowd spent the night in the cold outdoors.
The next morning the people were restless and hungry. And yet again the
TPLF subjected them to another three hours of indoctrination.


After testing the limit of the crowd's patience, on November 7th, the
TPLF released the four Ethiopian detainees. George Krois, the American
pilot, was nowhere to be found. The TPLF said he would be released "very
soon" and sent the crowd and Ethiopian captives back to Abiy Adi.

#### The Americans and Canadians Informed


By this time, UN Locust Control Head, Mulugeta informed the US
Ambassador Fred Chapin of Krois' abduction. Ambassador Chapin dispatched
a cable to US Secretary of [State Cyrus
Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Vance) to officially notify
the State Department of the abduction of an American citizen by the
TPLF.

*Fred Chapin, left,(Ambassador to Ethiopia) and Cyrus Vance, right Secretary of State 1977 - 80*


Secretary Vance then promptly made plans to notify Krois' father in
California. Unfamiliar with the TPLF bandits at this time, he [sent a
cable back](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE282814_d.html)
to Ambassador Chapin inquiring: if they "could. make a point that any
publicity TPLF garners from the kidnapping would be bad? Or would TPLF
care as long as they got publicity?"


Ambassador Chapin received the cable and looped in the Canadians which
had a stake in Krois' release since Krois was a Canadian resident with a
wife in Toronto.

Both determined to coordinate plans and "[to hold the story as tightly
as possible](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04739_d.html)"
to starve the TPLF of any publicity.

#### American Call on a Friend


Lacking a direct point of contact with the TPLF, the American Ambassador
in Sudan, Donald Bergus, [appealed to the Sudanese
Government](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05432_d.html)
of Jaafar Nimeiry. Nimeiry, a close US and Egyptian ally, was providing
financial support and a headquarters in Khartoum to the TPLF\[3\].

*Jaafar Nimeiry (left), Sudanese President 1971-85, Donald Bergus (right) US Ambassador to Sudan, 1977-80*


Ambassador Bergus phoned General Omar Al-Tayeb, head of the Sudanese
State Security under Nimeiry, and pressed him to approach TPLF
representatives in Khartoum to negotiate Krois' release. After meeting
TPLF reps in Khartoum, General Omar reported: "[TPLF want money or
material assistance of some kind before release of
Krois](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05550_d.html)".

Omar told TPLF of US policy prohibiting ransom of any kind for release
of hostages and that any donation would be made "[under the
table](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05550_d.html)".


Ambassador Bergus then sent a cable to the State Department to update
Secretary of State Vance about the TPLF's demands as relayed by General
Omar. Bergus then waited for next steps from the State Department.

Meanwhile, the Canadians also hatched a plan of their own.

#### The Canadians Call on a Friend


The Canadian strategy involved reaching out to the British which dealt
with TPLF terrorists two years earlier when they ambushed and fired
bullets on a Land Rover of a British family, including a 5 and 8 year
old, and took the family hostage for 3 months demanding \$1M in
ransom\[2\].

![](/images/blog/the-untold-story-of-a-tplf-hostage-crisis-61206757c8b80c4075538adf_Scree-b2abed6e.png)
*Sep 7 1978 NY Times Article about abduction of British Family by TPLF.*


British officials reached out to their TPLF contacts and reported the
following:

"[An official of the British embassy who negotiated Tyler family release
was telephoned by TPLF rep late this morning. He refused to meet TPLF at
embassy but instead set up meeting this
evening](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05432_d.html)".


After meeting in secret with the TPLF rep, the British official notified
the Canadians that the rep said unless a ransom was given "[Krois would
continue to be held to draw attention to the TPLF cause" and that "his
group was immune to pressure applied by
governments](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS04980_d.html)".


Back in Washington, Secretary Vance emphatically rejected the TPLF
ransom demand, and updated his ambassadors in Addis and Khartoum
affirming that "[there is no question of USG paying ransom and TPLF will
only damage its public image by continuing to hold innocents
hostage](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE302460_d.html)".


He added, "[we should use as many channels as possible to bring pressure
to bear on TPLF, embassy should therefore again ask governments to make
another strong effort to persuade TPLF to release Krois immediately and
without
condition](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE302460_d.html)".


TPLF reps would not budge. They warned a French contact "[Krois is well
but that he will be kept as long as necessary 'six months or a year' to
bring western interlocutors to their
senses](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS05334_d.html)".

The contact also noted that although a clear ransom demand had not been
made yet, "[figure being contemplated is thought to be approximately
\$100,000 or \$200,000 in
cash](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS05334_d.html)".

#### TPLF Tries to Indoctrinate Krois' Mother


Now early one morning, TPLF reps approached a Red Cross official  in
Khartoum by the name of Fred Isler and demanded that he [deliver three
letters](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05432_d.html)
\[4\] addressed to Mrs. Beverely Krois (George Krois' mother in Toronto)
to the Canadian embassy to send to Mrs. Krois.


Isler accepted the first two letters which were letters from George to
his mother describing his situation, but according to a mid-November
cable, "[Isler refused to accept a third letter which was a
propagandistic explanation from TPLF to Mrs. Krois" justifying Krois'
captivity](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05432_d.html)".


Isler "[told TPLF Krois was not a POW but a civilian who'd been
kidnapped. He said @ICRC wouldn't be party to a case of kidnapping
except to carry humane messages. TPLF then took back letter from Krois
to his mother because they wanted it and their letter to reach her at
same time.](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KHARTO05432_d.html)"


In the propaganda letter Isler refused, TPLF wrote to Mrs. Krois "the
inconvenience of one man for an indefinite period of time" is a
worthwhile price to pay for "five million Tigreans".

They also complained, stating "[for the last hundred years the Amhara
nation dominated
us](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978CAIRO25216_d.html)".


Though TPLF ultimately pulled back the letters, the gesture presumably
was an attempt to demonstrate that they have matured into humane
kidnappers. In 1976, a British man kidnapped by the TPLF remarked that
he "[had to suck water from cactuses to keep
going](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yes-i-remember-holding-you-hostage-come-and-stay-hv8z0zst75m)"
on a 500 mile march under armed TPLF guards.

#### Canadians Want UN Involved, Americans Unconvinced


By December, the one month mark of Krois' abduction had passed. US and
Canadian officials were still no closer to securing Krois' release as
when they had started.

The Canadians proposed that the UN Secretary General make a public
appeal [to the TPLF on humanitarian
grounds](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS05334_d.html).

![](/images/blog/the-untold-story-of-a-tplf-hostage-crisis-61207451415c590de7aa2ce7_waldh-6c9fec1a.png)
*Kurt Waldheim, UN Secretary General 1972 - 81*


Ambassador Chapin and the Americans were unconvinced arguing "[an appeal
on humanitarian grounds would, in any case, fall on deaf ears. The TPLF
has clearly shown itself to be a politically unsophisticated group, not
concerned with the adverse nature of the publicity it might
get.](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978ADDIS05334_d.html)"


In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State [Warren
Christopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Christopher) had now
taken over the Krois' file. (Christopher would become Secretary of State
under Bill Clinton). Christopher was displeased with the Sudanese effort
so far and called for more
"[aggressive](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE322216_d.html)"
pressure against the Sudanese.

Soon enough, the Sudanese feeling the heat, reassured the US Ambassador
in Khartoum that the matter was now personally being handled by Sudanese
President Nimeiry and promised renewed pressure would be applied on the
TPLF leadership in Khartoum.


Sudanese authorities would then summon TPLF reps in Khartoum. What
exactly happened next is unclear. The details of the exchange remain
classified. It's possible the Sudanese threatened the TPLF with
expulsion or the Eritreans who had leverage on the TPLF made them fold.


It's also unclear whether any of the TPLF's ransom demands were met
"under the table" by the Sudanese officials. The Sudanese promised the
TPLF a press conference in Khartoum and requested US officials send
media reps to the press conference. The US would grudgingly accept.


After more than 2 months of a dizzying diplomatic frenzy and 70 days
under TPLF captivity, George Krois' would finally be a free man on
January 9 after the TPLF handed him to Sudanese authorities in Khartoum.
A week later he boarded a flight to Toronto and reunited with his wife.

*Jan 10 NY Times Article on release of George Krois*


President Nimeiry received a letter of thanks from President Jimmy
Carter for his efforts. Carter wrote: "[I would like to express my
gratitude for your government's efforts in bringing about the safe
release of Mr. George William Krois by the Tigre Peoples Liberation
Front](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1979STATE007630_e.html)".

#### Carter Falls, TPLF Terrorism Increases


Only a year later President Jimmy Carter would find himself confronting
another hostage crisis, only this time one which he could not keep under
wraps and would ultimately take down his Presidency.

*Jimmy Carter Loses 1980 Election due in large part to his inability to handle Iran Hostage Crisis*

Carter would go down, but TPLF terrorists were just getting started.


TPLF also got its promised press conference with western media and said
"they were anxious to call attention of world opinion to plight of
Tigrean people who were fighting a fascist government".

If this language sounds familiar, we don't need to look further than the
recent words coming out of today's TPLF terrorists who have waged war on
the country:

> [\#Ethiopia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethiopia?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

For the George Krois' kidnapping and more than a dozen other documented
acts of international terrorism committed throughout the 70s and 80s,
 the TPLF found itself listed as a [Tier III terrorist
organization](https://bit.ly/2W8ow9l) under United States law.


Yet, despite their rocky beginning, the TPLF and the US would forge a
closer relationship in the late 80s. Ethiopia would expell Ambassador
Chapin and the Americans in July 1980 and the US wouldn't regain a
foothold in the country until facilitating a TPLF takeover in 1991.

Today, once again, true to its terrorist roots, the TPLF, with American
approval, is terrorizing the people of Tigray, Amhara, and Afar regions
and holding them hostage while demanding a ransom of more than 100
million Ethiopians.

#### Notes

1.  The US had [been aware of efforts to create a "Tigray Liberation
    Front"](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975ADDIS05179_b.html) at
    least since April 1975, which is two months after TPLF's official
    founding.
2.  British Surgeon Lindsey Taylor was on vacation with his wife and his
    8 and 5 year old children when TPLF gunmen ambushed his vehicle and
    kidnapped the family. This
    [story](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yes-i-remember-holding-you-hostage-come-and-stay-hv8z0zst75m)
    on the Sunday Times recounts this event and also an addition TPLF
    kidnapping.
3.  Incidentally, just like today, in 1977-78 while Ethiopia was
    preoccupied with war with Somalia, Nimeiry's troops [invaded fertile
    lands](https://politicstoday.org/all-out-war-between-ethiopia-and-sudan-on-the-doorstep/)
    of Ethiopian farmers in Gonder and in later years, according to a
    [statement](https://ecadforum.com/2016/01/24/the-tigray-peoples-liberation-front-executes-its-longstanding-promise/)
    by the Ethiopian Border Affairs Committee, TPLF leaders promised
    Neimery that they would abrogate the 1902 Border Treaty if they took
    power in Ethiopia.

    Krois](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978CAIRO25216_d.html).
