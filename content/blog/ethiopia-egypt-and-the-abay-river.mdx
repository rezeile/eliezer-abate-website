The Abay river tumbles out of the Ethiopian highlands from its source in
[Lake Tana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tana) and embarks on an
800km journey through a deep gorge as large as the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado River until it makes a sharp western turn and meets the White
Nile near Khartoum, Sudan.

Ethiopia is constructing a hydroelectirc dam on this river (called Abay
in Ethiopia) at the edge of its western border with Sudan. [The Grand
Ethiopian Renaissance
Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ethiopian_Renaissance_Dam)
(GERD) broke ground in 2011 and is now nearing completion.  
  
This project has been fully financed by the Ethiopian public and has
cemented itself as a monument of national pride for the country.

*Abay River Originating From Lake Tana*

  
  
Egypt, a downstream consumer of the Nile river has opposed the
construction of this dam from the beginning. Nonetheless, that didn't
stop Ethiopia from breaking ground on the project nearly a decade ago.  
  
The dam is now at the final stages of completion and these two countries
are at a crossroads again about the filling and operation of the dam.   
  
Egypt contends that the filling of this dam will reduce its current flow
of the Nile waters. Ethiopia argues that it has the right to fully
utilize waters of the Abay river which originates in its country in Lake
Tana.  
  
Furthermore, Ethiopia believes that it has already accommodated Egypt's
concerns by agreeing to fill this dam over a prolonged course of three
to seven years.   
  
The moral, historical, economic, and legal dimensions of this dispute
collectively make it one of the most interesting and important
geopolitical issues of the 21st century and a harbinger of other climate
and resource related conflicts to come.  
  
Arriving at a long-term solution to this dispute is crucial to the
development of both these countries and Africa's economic future.
