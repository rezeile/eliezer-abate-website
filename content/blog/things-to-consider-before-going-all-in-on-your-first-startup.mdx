This essay is a retrospective about my journey founding a food discovery
startup called idk over the course of the past of 2019. I have written
the tldr of the major lessons I took away right below, and if you’re
interested in the longer form narrative, keep reading, hopefully you’ll
find other useful nuggets.

  

TLDR: 

  

- Have one founder, (hopefully the CEO), whose sole responsibility is to
  raise money so that your startup can get off the ground. 
- Start thinking about potential investment partners as early as you
  think about a startup and prepare for the long haul (6months -
  12months) of fundraising. 
- As a first-time founder with no-exit, realize that 9/10 investors will
  look at you skeptically and so make sure either your product blows
  them away, you have revenue numbers to show off, or engagement numbers
  to show off. 
- If you decide to self-fund, make sure you have at least 12 months of
  living expenses covered -- among your founding team -- so that you put
  yourself in a position to make solid headway with your product. 

  

Over the course of 2019, I worked on a startup called idk. I began
working on this project when I got together with my co-founder, who was
a childhood friend of mine. We both had grand ambitions about succeeding
in technology and becoming very rich. Other than this grand ambition, we
did not have a clear-cut idea of what to build, how to raise money, and
how to monetize the product we were building.  
  
It seems obvious, in hindsight, that these should have been topics that
we should have spent considerable time breaking down, but because of our
preternatural bias towards action, we felt that if we continued to
build, talk to users, and just keep making progress day by day, that
these issues would resolve themselves. Or more likely, we felt that we
would have a better mental model and framework with which we can come up
with solutions to the questions above.  
  
I went to Stanford and studied Computer Science as an undergrad.
Everyone in Silicon Valley and beyond knows that countless tech
entrepreneurs came out of this storied institution and founded iconic
companies from Google to Snap to endless others. Still, as an undergrad,
I was focused on obtaining the technical skills necessary to build these
companies. I had mistakenly believed that all it took to build great
technology companies was technical prowess. Basically the idea that I
can build a great software product with the CS skills that I was
learning, and commercialize that product and make a lot of money.  
  
Part of the reason that I had this mistaken belief was because I knew
that having great technical chops was *necessary* to build a great
software startup and that those who did not have these technical skills
had no chance succeeding in founding a technology startup. Most of the
widely heralded founders and CEOs that I observed in the tech press I
was consuming -- from Zuck, to Sergey and Larry, to Jeff Bezos and Elon
-- were all highly technical people with a software background at some
point in their lives. So I had this conviction that there would be
absolutely no way to make it in technology as a startup founder unless
one had experience building software at some point in their lives.  
  
Furthermore, from reading dozens of
[essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) from Paul Graham, I
picked up the idea that traditional business-minded, MBA types, were
held in disdain by the tech community. So I was committed to not having
a business co-founder when I pursued my tech startup at some point. My
plan was to pursue an enterprise or B2B unglamorous startup that was
very product and software heavy. 

  

However, when I got together with my co-founder in March of 2019, he had
a very consumer-centric mobile app idea and it became clear to me that
he hadn’t even explored the realm of non-consumer ideas. He was even
more of a novice than I was. He had never seen how products are actually
built in a startup or software setting and so he came with a layman’s
understanding of what was possible. His background was in door-to-door
sales selling copiers to local businesses on foot.  
  
I hadn’t obviously built my own startup before, but I had built software
projects with teams composed of product managers, designers, data
analysts, and many top-notch engineers at some of the top companies in
Silicon Valley and I had a good sense of what was technically required
to get our product off the ground into a usable stage.  
  
We were first-time founders and convinced that we needed to get the
product live out to users before we had any shot at raising money from
angel investors and early stage venture capitalists. So we built and
built and built some more for about five months and we launched our
first product to public users in September of 2019. During our launch
day, we had about four-hundred people download and use our app, mostly
people that my co-founder knew from social media.  
  
We had a toast to celebrate our first launch, and immediately several
things started becoming very clear about our business. First, we
realized that we were geographically limited. Our food discovery app
only served people in a particular geographical location at a time. It
was not a photo-sharing app that can be used by anybody anywhere in the
world. So even though we were getting downloads from across the United
States, we knew that the usability of our app was limited only to folks
living in the southern California area. 

  

Secondly, we now wanted to know what it took to raise money. I had
talked to friends that had raised money without getting as far into a
launch as we had gotten and had the idea that all we needed was to just
check off a bunch of checklists and thresholds and we would eventually
become acceptable to investors. I was conditioned to having this
mistaken idea from my experience getting into college or other highly
competitive programs where the application was clearcut and all one had
to do was make sure she meets all the pre-specified criteria.  
  
But I soon realized that the venture capital world was different. The
entrepreneur not only had to go out and sell the product, but more
importantly she has to relentlessly hustle and sell her vision to a
peculiar group of people who hear ideas and pitches hundreds and
sometimes thousands of times a year. Finding the door and connections to
decision-makers that can potentially invest in your company is actually
intentionally *not* clear cut at all.  
  
At this point it became abundantly clear that raising money was going to
be difficult no matter how much we improved our product. The investors
and accelerators we ended up meeting all wanted to see significant
traction in the way of users or revenue. As our personal savings were
dwindling down with no investor’s in sight, the rate of our product
iterations also began to suffer. We were concerned that we were going to
run out of runway, we didn’t have any investor meetings lined up, and
our product was getting stale to our users and we were spending lots of
money on paid traffic in order to satisfy the whims of a potential angel
investor who wanted to see 10000 users before he can make a decision to
invest. Just like a guy trying too hard to woo an attractive girl, we
began to reek of desperation and to see the writing on the wall.  
  
IDK did not work out because we couldn’t figure out how to pursue
building the product while providing for our living expenses. In other
words, we ran out of money -- *our own* money.  
  

Like most people, I thought if we got a product out, that would signal
to investors that we were ahead of most of our early stage competition
and investment dollars would follow. But that was actually quite
foolish. Investors are more than anything looking for a battle-tested
team, social validation from other investors or notable accelerators,
and a history of getting impressive things accomplished. To be clear,
having the technical chops necessary to get your product out is a
*necessary* condition, but not a *sufficient* one to impress the
investorati. So my advice to my current and previous self would be to
focus more on getting the overall vision, and storyline, and investor
connection set up right, before hunkering down and writing the first
line of code.
