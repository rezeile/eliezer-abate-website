#### Introduction

There are a class of problems in technical interviews that will ask you
to design a typically known game or data structure using object oriented
principles. You may be asked to design a data structure like a Hash Map
or an LRU cache or simulate a game like Tic Tac Toe or a system like a
Browser's history functionality.

#### An Example

Design Tic Tac Toe. You have to implement a class named *TicTacToe*
which will take an integer n representing an nxn grid and you need to
implement a method called *move* that will take a row, column and player
that will place an item. The player id is either 1 or 2 and the move
method will return the winner everytime it's called. If there is no
winner it returns 0 otherwise it will return either player 1 or 2.

The key insight to realize for this problem is that a tic tac toe game
can only be won if a player places an item entirely in a row, column or
one of the two diagonals. So we only need to keep track of the number of
placements by each player for each row, column, diagonal, and
*antidiagonal.* One clever way to do this is to keep for arrays of size
N and if player 1 places an item add 1 to the respective
row,column,diagonal, or antidiagonal or if player 2 places an item add
-1. If at anypoint any of these four arrays contains total value of size
N for a row,column, diagonal or antidiagonal, then the player that just
placed the item is the winner. The code follows below:
