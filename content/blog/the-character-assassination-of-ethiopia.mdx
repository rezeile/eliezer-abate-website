On Monday June 15, EU envoy to Ethiopia [Pekka
Haavisto](https://twitter.com/haavisto?lang=en) unleashed one of the
most disgusting slanders to date against Ethiopia's leadership falsely
accusing officials of saying "they are going to [wipe out the
Tigrayans](https://apnews.com/article/europe-ethiopia-africa-ffd3dc3faf15d0501fd87cafe274e65a)
for 100 years" in a February closed door meeting.

  
This derogatory fabrication was [swiftly
condemned](https://www.facebook.com/MFAEthiopia/photos/pcb.4826141894079682/4826140767413128/?type=3&theater)
by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry as the ludicrous babbling of a
deranged old man suffering from a "hallucination of sorts or a lapse in
memory of some kind".

  
The Foreign Ministry went even further and bluntly called out Haavisto
as a flat out racist and banned him from ever setting foot on Ethiopian
soil again.

  
How did this disgraceful episode get covered by the media? If you were
to glance at the headlines and coverage by the AP and other western
sources, Haavisto's inflammatory accusation is presented as if it were a
true statement.

  
The American and European press which pat each other in the back in
perennial award ceremonies and tout themselves as paragons of
independent journalism have demonstrated that they are nothing more than
propagandists for their governments.

  
Statements coming from EU or American officials are uncritically
accepted as fact and those of Ethiopia's leaders as unmitigated lies.
The western diplomats and press aren't just failing to meet basic
ethical standards of journalism and diplomacy but are in an outright war
with the truth

  
Even the incontrovertible fact that the TPLF attacked an Ethiopian army
base to ignite the Tigray conflict is cast aside with suspicion and
qualified with "Abiy accuses the TPLF of attacking a federal army base"
as if the massacre of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers is a footnote.

"How did Abiy Ahmed go from Nobel Prize winner to alleged ethnic
cleanser?" in which the two spend 30 minutes painting a prejudicial
trope of Abiy Ahmed as a sadistic leader who delights in rape, famine,
and torture.

that "We should apply every ounce of leverage we have to rein in a
savagery in Tigray that increasingly reeks of genocide".

All these sanctimonious journalists and diplomats are clearly deluded
and believe they are morally superior to Ethiopians.

  
They concoct salacious stories putting words in their unsuspecting
Tigrayan sources mouths like: "they want to cleanse your bloodline?" and
bask in self-adulation: "after our report the American government dished
out sanctions on Ethiopian officials. We're so damn good!"

  
The unrelenting, months long, character assassination of Ethiopia, Prime
Minister Abiy Ahmed, Eritrea and the Amhara by a morally bankrupt lot of
European and American officials and journalists does not stem from a
single ounce of concern for the people of Tigray.

  
These defamation campaigns waged against Ethiopia by the journalist and
diplomat descendants of slaveholders, colonialists, and genociders stem
from the same tree whose bitter fruit made their forefathers view
Africans as subhuman savages that need to be civilized.
