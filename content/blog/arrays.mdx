Array problems are many and can be some of the trickiest in the
business. There are many problems that seek the maximum or minimum value
of subarrays and subsequences and there could be many ways to solve a
problem. Problems with arrays can be solved with Dynamic Programming,
Two Pointers, Sliding Window or using a data structure such as a Hash
Map or a Heap. Below are some problems categorized by problem solving
strategy.

| Problem | Strategy | Description |
