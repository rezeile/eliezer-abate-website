[Skunkworks](https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003)
is a riveting memoir by Ben Rich about his years working at Lockheed's
top-secret Skunkworks program first as an engineer, then as the head of
the organization for close to twenty years. In this first-person
account, we get to peek into the brilliant mind of a manager and a group
of enterprising engineers, chemists, physicists and all-around doers
that made the impossible possible and produced some of America's most
iconic military aircraft from the U2 spy plane to the record-setting
SR-71 Blackbird which blazed at three times the speed of sound.  

In the first half of the book Rich chronicles the story of Kelly
Johnson, the formidable and charismatic chief engineer who founded the
program. Johnson is a larger-than-life figure that reminds one of the
legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden who left an impression on
his players that extended far beyond the basketball court. Similarly,
the lessons and fear that Johnson instilled in his employees is palpable
throughout Rich's words and the accounts of other employees, pilots,
generals, and Secretaries of State who are profiled in the book.

Indeed one of the highlights of the books is we get to hear from some of
the most towering figures of the Cold War from former National Security
Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski to Secretary of State William Perry about
how crucial a role the Skunkworks team played in ensuring America's
military advantage during the era.\

We also get to peek inside the Pentagon's bureaucracy and its Byzantine
rules and regulations which made life somewhat frustrating for both Rich
and Johnson. Despite their stellar record, the team ran into the same
issues that most of us run into in the corporate world today from
inflated egos, unexpected change of direction from the top, and
backbiting characters.\

The pace at which most of the planes got built is truly astonishing.
Most of the planes that were took less than 24 months from conception to
prototype. The focus, grit, ingenuity, and high degree of excellence
that was expected of SkunkWorks employees can be credited for this rapid
and prolific output which didn't sacrifice quality.\

My biggest takeaway from this book is that we should be fearless about
tackling challenges that may seem uncomfortable or unknown at first.
Most of the projects that the Skunkworks team undertook were zero-to-one
projects that had never been done before. The team had mastered the
fundamentals in each of their endeavors and was able to improvise to
create products that revolutionized the game.\
