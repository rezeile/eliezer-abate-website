## Tigray

Joe Biden sent his close ally Senator [Chris
Coons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coons) of Delaware to the
Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to deliver what a White House official
termed a ["tough
message"](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/18/biden-chris-coons-senator-ethiopia-tigray-crisis/)
to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Before Senator Coons landed in Addis
Ababa, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted a stern [warning to new TPLF
recruits and
allies](https://twitter.com/PMEthiopia/status/1372883442220826627?s=20)
to surrender giving an early signal that he is not likely to be swayed
by Senator Coon's request to end hostilities with the TPLF.  
  
On the day of Mr. Coons visit, The Eritrean Embassy to Addis Ababa
[telegraphed a message of
"self-reliance"](https://twitter.com/ERIEMBAET/status/1373347584341913601)
signaling that Asmara is keenly aware that the Senator was dispatched to
create [a rift between the two
countries](https://robertjprince.net/2021/03/18/ethiopia-following-in-the-path-of-yugoslavia-iraq-libya-and-what-washington-hoped-to-do-in-syria-susan-rices-war-washington-weaponizing-human-rights-again-this-time-in-ethiopia-prelude-to-a/)
through threats of economic and diplomatic strong-arming.

The United States also announced [$52 million of humanitarian
aid](https://www.state.gov/u-s-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-for-the-tigray-crisis-response/)
to Tigray following last week's announcement that  it had halted
[assistance to most programs in the security
sector.](https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-conflict-usa-assistance-idUSL1N2LA2QA)
Justice Department records indicate that both the TPLF and the Ethiopian
government are aggressively [lobbying politicians in Washington
DC.](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2021/03/19/who-is-lobbying-in-the-ethiopia-conflict-as-coons-heads-to-addis-ababa-794124)

A spokesperson for the Amhara regional government confirmed that the
[Ethiopian government has
approved](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/ethiopia-s-amhara-seize-disputed-territory-amid-tigray-conflict)
the reincorporation of Wolkait, Tegede, Telemet, Humera, and Raya
regions and rejected US' assertion that ethnic-cleansing had taken place
in parts of these regions.

The UN Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet [accepted an
invitation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-un-idUSKBN2B934E)
from the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to jointly investigate
alleged war crimes.

Media organizations recently granted access to the Tigray region are
sounding the alarm about the high number of cases of
[rape](https://www.channel4.com/news/the-horrors-of-the-hidden-war-inside-the-tigray-conflict-in-ethiopia)
and [sexual
violence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/africa/ethiopia-tigray-rape-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html?utm_source=fbCNNi&utm_campaign=africa&utm_medium=social)
in the region. The Ethiopian government, through its UK embassy, has
responded to these reports and vowed to ["thoroughly investigate these
allegations and bring perpetrators to
justice".](https://twitter.com/EthioAmbUK/status/1372658106229010436?s=20)

## GERD, Egypt & Sudan

Sudan formally [requested the involvement of the European Union, United
States, and the
UN](https://www.voanews.com/africa/sudan-requests-un-us-eu-help-resolve-dam-conflict-ethiopia)
in the ongoing dispute over the filling and operation of the Grand
Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.

Ethiopian officials flatly rejected calls for external mediation. One of
the Ethiopian chief negotiators stated that Egypt & Sudan's calls to
involve these external parties is intended to ["pressurize Ethiopia to
accept their proposal which will strip the rights of the country to
develop its water resources"](https://www.ena.et/en/?p=22772).

Egypt also took to the UN General Assembly to [express concerns about
Ethiopia's plans to fill the dam this coming
summer](https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/406345/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-expresses-worry-over-GERD-deadlock-to-UN-Gen.aspx).

Chairman of Sudan's Transitional Government, President Abdel Fattah Al
Burhan signaled that there will be [no diplomatic solution to the border
dispute](https://twitter.com/SUNA_AGENCY/status/1372265141883011075?s=20)
between the two countries and that the Sudanese Armed Forces will not
vacate to their pre-incursion positions.
